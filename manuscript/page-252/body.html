<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent ">everything was making its imprint with a strange, senseless precision on me; the golden scythe which was nothing more than the reflection of light from the loud-speaker of the lecture apparatus:</p><p>under the loud-speaker a child, a living illustration. It was leaning toward the loud-speaker, a fold of its infinitesimal unit in its mouth, its little fist clenched firmly, its thumb squeezed into the fist, a light fluffy pleat of skin at the wrist. Like a photographic plate I was taking in the impression of all this. Now I saw how its naked leg hung over the edge of the platform, the pink fan of its finger waved in the air One minute more, one second, and the child would be on the floor!</p><p>A female's scream, a wave of translucent wings, her unit on the platform! She caught the child, her lips clung to the fluffy pleat of the baby's wrist; she moved the child to the middle of the table and left the platform.</p></div> </div>
