Publishers and theaters were intimidated into ignoring him; libraries were forbidden to circulate his work. In June 1931 Zamiatin wrote a letter to Joseph Stalin. This letter was not the sort that dictators are accustomed to receive. Far from being an abject plea, it displayed an unruffled dignity underscored by an ironical tone. The author stated that he was no longer free to continue with his writing, that such a situation was for him tantamount to a death sentence, and that he was requesting permission to leave the Soviet Union. Permission was granted and, for all practical purposes, Zamiatin's career came to an end. Cut off from the immediate reality of Russia, he never again produced anything that equaled his earlier work.</p></div> </div>
