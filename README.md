### TABLET FIRST & OFFLINE FIRST

Superbooks are naturally responsive and are generally [supported](https://bubblin.io/support) across all browsers and devices. However, the most ideal surface to read these books on (recommended) are the \~9" tablets like the iPad or the Galaxy Tab. 

We try and suppport all devices and desktops—meaning, all modern browsers, all viewports and all operating systems starting from an Apple Watch to an LCD TV. See our full list of supported devices [here](https://bubblin.io/devices). 

The live book is _offline-first_ using a Service Worker, so no explicit download is required to read or share the book OFFLINE.

### MANUSCRIPT (this repo)

The manuscript on this repo has been generated programmatically using [Bookiza Abelone](https://bookiza.io), [h2s](https://github.com/bookiza/h2s) and a few other markup sanitization libraries.


:point_right: Note, this git repository is the `manuscript` while the book is _live_ and served hot on the url provided on top. This difference in the 'state of work' is part of the vocabulary when publishing with Bookiza.


### FULLSCREEN MODE:

To be able to read the book in [fullscreen mode](https://bubblin.io/blog/fullscreen-api-ipad), please try these steps:

- Open the book on iOS (> 12.00) Safari
- Tap the `...` button at bottom right of the screen to open Superbook controls.
- Tap `⤮` on the top right (middle button) to go fullscreen.

iPadOS Safari v12.0 and above only.

## HACKING, FIXES AND TRANSLATIONS


#### A. HACKING THE BOOK

For example, if you want to mint your own edition of `Pride & Prejudice` (like typesetting it yourself or adding art or illustrations to the book), follow the below given steps:
