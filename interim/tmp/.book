  "page-9": "<h3>Introduction</h3><p>It is pointless to see the tragedy of Soviet Russian literature, as some do, in the mere existence of great numbers of literary hacks, since even democratic societies are heavily burdened by inferior writers. The real tragedy of post-revolutionary Russian literature lies in what has happened to a small number of exceptional authors who, under normal circumstances, would have made us forget the mediocre crowd. Through unofficial and official pressures, these few talented men were forced into silence, into varying degrees of conformity, or into exile. The names of most of them are hardly known to their countrymen or to the world. One of these unusual men was Evgeni Ivanovich Zamiatin, who died in France as a voluntary exile in 1937.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">Zamiatin was born in 1884 in the Central Russian</p>",
  "page-10": "<p class=\"no-indent \">town of Lebedian. While studying at the St. Petersburg Poly-technical Institute, he developed an interest in social and political problems, an interest that was to be strongly reflected in his literary work. He became actively involved in the revolutionary movement and suffered both imprisonment and banishment. A tale called \"Provincial Life,\" which came out in 1911, was Zamiatin's first ambitious attempt at writing, and it showed him to be a meticulous craftsman with exceptionally acute analytical powers.</p><p>Three years later these talents were again demonstrated in \"At the End of the World,\" a story for which the government tried unsuccessfully to prosecute him on the grounds of antimilitarism. In 1917 Zamiatin published \"The Islanders\" and \"The Fisher of Men,\" tales In which his satirical abilities were first given full play, with the English among whom he had lived briefly during the war—serving as the victims.</p>",
  "page-11": "<p>Zamiatin had worked and suffered so that the Revolution might take place. When it finally became a reality, he greeted it with enthusiasm and spent endless hours in lecture halls and conference rooms on its behalf. But he was quick to notice the alarming tendencies that were developing in the new society, and in his writing he boldly pointed out the impending dangers. \"I Fear, an essay which appeared in 1920, warned against the insidious pressures for conformity: the new Russia would have no real literature until it cured itself of this illness; and if the illness proved incurable, then there would be only one future for Russian literature—its past. The novel We, written in the same year, treated the problem of conformity on a much broader scale.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">Although the book could not be published in the Soviet Union, it was not unknown to the critics there, since it was read in manuscript form and, during the</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent \">twenties, appeared abroad in English, French, and Czech translations. In such short stories as \"Draco,\" \"The Cave,\" \"Mamai,\" and \"A Story about the Most Important Matter,\" Zamiatin stressed with satirical force the cruelty, the pettiness, and the futility characterizing Russia under the new order. His play, The Fires of St.Dominic, while ostensibly dealing with the.Spanish Inquisition, was actually aimed at the activities of the Soviet security police. In criticism, fiction, and drama that showed his constantly maturing satirical and analytical abilities, Zamiatin fought to preserve his vision of the Revolution.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">Antagonized by Zamiatin's insistence on telling the truth as he saw it, by his open disdain for anything that smacked of literary servility, Communist critics opened an offensive against him which reached an incredibly vituperative intensity after 1929, when a Russian version of We (allegedly retranslated from the Czech)</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent \">was published abroad.</p><p>Zamiatin, the self-styled \"devil of Soviet literature,\" was thoroughly exorcised, and every effort was made to prevent any further contact between him and the public. Publishers and theaters were intimidated into ignoring him; libraries were forbidden to circulate his work. In June 1931 Zamiatin wrote a letter to Joseph Stalin. This letter was not the sort that dictators are accustomed to receive. Far from being an abject plea, it displayed an unruffled dignity underscored by an ironical tone. The author stated that he was no longer free to continue with his writing, that such a situation was for him tantamount to a death sentence, and that he was requesting permission to leave the Soviet Union. Permission was granted and, for all practical purposes, Zamiatin's career came to an end. Cut off from the immediate reality of Russia, he never again produced anything that equaled his earlier work.</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line\">Initially because of his time-consuming service in the revolutionary cause and later because of the frustrating pressures that gradually deprived him of access to editorial and theater offices, Zamiatin's quantitative contribution to Soviet Russian criticism, fiction, and drama was very slim. But if the Zamiatin chapter of Soviet Russian literature is necessarily brief, it is nevertheless' brilliant, for here was a man who possessed the social and psychological perceptiveness, the courage, and the technical skill which identify the real creative artist. Such a man can produce work that is vitally significant in his own era and that retains this significance with the passage of time. This is true of Zamiatin's short stories, plays, and criticism. They were important for his day and have kept their freshness with the passage of time. But the writing of such a man can, in its basic conception, leap beyond immediacy. It may have a certain topical relevancy in his time, but its main</p>",
  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent \">impact will be saved for the future. The novel Webelongs in this category. Today, in the problems it poses, it is even more important than it was thirty-nine years ago.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">It is an example of how man's imagination can intuitively grasp the essence of his own future problems. In the first years of the twenties, We was simply another variation on the utopian theme, a clever, stimulating, satirical fantasy that inspired speculation and debate. The ruling principle of the rigidly controlled society in We is that freedom and happiness are incompatible: men are congenitally incapable of using their freedom for constructive ends and merely make themselves miserable by their abuse of it; most of them yearn for a materialistic happiness and are eager to surrender their troublesome freedom and to be reduced to the status of lotus-eaters. This was hardly a new theory, except in its application. Zamiatin had obviously</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent \">become intrigued by the guiding philosophy of the Grand Inquisitor in Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov and had skillfully adapted it to the needs of a modern technological state. But provocative as this restatement was, a stable society based on it was hardly credible within the context of those years. Although strange and ugly social and political theories were circulating and even being put into limited practice, it was still generally believed that man was not desperately committed to a goal of materialistic happiness and that he was a born rebel who, except during such emergencies as wartime, could not be forced to tolerate more than a minimal amount of regimentation for very long. What made We even less credible were the scientific advances which it predicted.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">At that time there was also an unintentionally comic note for most readers. Zamiatin was obviously thinking about future developments in the Soviet Union when</p>",
  "page-17": "<p class=\"no-indent \">he wrote We, and to any sensible person the implication that that backward country could ever build a successful interplanetary rocket was ludicrous.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">When the modern totalitarian states proved how meticulously they could refine and organize the apparatus of control, then history finally began to catch up with We. The mathematical precision of life in Zamiatin's glass paradise was no longer an improbable nightmare. We seemed almost like an early blueprint for what was now happening in the world, an advanced textbook for theregimentation of mankind. In the novel there were unanimous elections which were unabashedly ritualistic in nature; prophylactic surveillance of private lives as well as torture were justified by reasoning that was as specious as it was pious; denunciations, even of those closest to one, were encouraged; children were considered the property of the state; and art was completely subservient to the aims</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent \">of society. These and other characteristics of the state that Zamiatin had envisioned were now integral parts of a way of life in totalitarian countries. With respect to the most extreme practices outlined in We, the question was not whether but when they would be realized. It became plain that even if man is born a rebel at heart, his psychological make-up is so plastic that he can usually be effectively intimidated to the point where he will accept a rigidly controlled pattern of life for a long period of time.</p><p>Since history proved Zamiatin right in this respect, the problems of the people in We who dared to think have lost their haze of unreality. In the light of what has been and is still occurring in totalitarian states, such problems have become fresh and compelling.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">But the prophetic scope of We has not been fully exhausted. Totalitarianism has shown that Zamiatin's state was right about the practicability of intensive</p>",
  "page-19": "<p class=\"no-indent \">regimentation over long periods of time; however, there has been no broad proving ground for the theory on which Zamiatin's state is built, the theory that most men believe their freedom to be more than a fair exchange for a high level of materialistic happiness. It appears, though, that this theory will be put to a final test in the future. If the present rapid rate of technological development continues, both totalitarian and democratic societies will be involved in this test. When the material wants of the Soviet people are satisfied, will many of them continue to resent regimentation? As we ourselves pursue even higher goals of materialistic happiness, the complexity of our technological society will increase and exert even more intense pressures for efficiency through the regulation of our lives. What decision will we make under those circumstances? Mankind is rushing toward a final proof or refutation of Zamiatin's prophecy.</p>",
  "page-20": "<p>In this novel, Zamiatin tried to put into practice his belief that in its content a literary work should be heretical, refusing to accept reality at its face value and always posing those two \"final, most terrifying, most fearless\" questions: Why? And what lies ahead? He also attempted to carry out his conviction that form should keep up with ideas, that only a heretical form could adequately dramatize heretical ideas. Drawing on the techniques of Gogol, Dostoevsky, Andreev, and Blok, Zamiatin had created his own synthesis, and this was now adapted to the special needs of We.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">The novel uses the notebook format, which is a particularly flexible medium for reflecting the varying moods of the narrator. A dynamic pace as well as a multidimensional characterization is obtained by techniques that are grounded in the principles of human psychology. As the narrator's emotional state changes, his perception moves between the extreme</p>",
  "page-21": "<p class=\"no-indent \">limits of objectivity and subjectivity.</p><p>There is a dramatic running duel between the rational and irrational forces within him, a shifting between his conscious and unconscious powers of perception, and a constant association of ideas that forms elaborate networks.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">Accompanying this psychological method is a laconic language that frequently lapses into the provocatively elliptical and imparts a sensation of breathlessness. Compressed and startlingly strange similes and metaphors are used in a variety of sophisticated roles: they not only serve the conventional purpose of intensifying the description of a person or object, but they also sharply characterize the narrator and his environment; they are frequently linked to an individual through so much repetition that they attain an impressionistic force; and sometimes they are employed as a triggering mechanism to flood the</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent \">reader's mind with impressions that were associated with these figures earlier in the narrative. The total effect of this imagery is to provide the novel with a strong inner unity.</p><p>Zamiatin once gave an apt metaphorical definition of good books, and this definition could well apply to We: \"There are books of the same chemical composition as dynamite. The difference lies only in the fact that one stick of dynamite explodes once, but one book explodes thousands of times.\" It is very unfortunate that circumstances prevented Zamiatin from writing other books with such an explosive potential. The ability was there, but the opportunity was not.</p><p>- PETER RUDY</p><p>NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY</p><p>1959</p>",
  "page-23": "<h3>Foreword</h3><p>In submitting this book to the American public the translator has this to say:</p><p>The artistic and psychological aspects of the novel are hardly to be discussed in a Foreword. Great as the art of the writer may be and profound as his psychological insight may seem to one, the impression is largely a matter of individual reactions, and this aspect must naturally be left to each individual's judgment and sensibilities.</p><p>There is, however, one side of the matter which deserves particular mention and even emphasis.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">This is perhaps the first time in the history of the last few decades that a Russian book, inspired by Russian life, written in Russia and in the Russian language, should see its first light not in Russia but</p>",
  "page-24": "<p class=\"no-indent \">abroad, and not in the language in which it was originally written, but translated into a foreign tongue.' During the darkest years of Russian history, in the forties, sixties, eighties and nineties of the last century many Russian writers were forced by oppression and reaction to live abroad and to write abroad, yet their writings would reach Russia, as they were intended primarily for the Russian reader and Russian life. Most of Turgenev's novels were written while he was in France, and with the exception of his last short story, which he dictated on his deathbed, all his novels and stories were written in Russian. Hertzen, Kropotkin, and at one time Dostoevsky, were similarly obliged to write while away from their native land.</p><p>History repeated itself recently in the case of Boris Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago.

But his book may not appear in the country where it was written.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">It is a great tragedy—this spiritual loneliness of the artist who cannot speak to his own people. In bringing out this book in English, the author tries to address himself to the world without having the opportunity of being heard by his own people. This situation, however, is to a great extent symbolic of the spiritual mission of Zamiatin, for no matter what the language in which he writes originally, and no matter how typically national his artistic perception and intuition, he is essentially universal, and his vision transcends the boundaries of a purely national art. Moreover, is it not true that the more genuinely national a man's art, and the more sincerely national his personality, the more- universal he becomes? Abraham Lincoln is much more than just an</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent \">American national figure, and I doubt if the appeal of Lincoln's personality would be so universal if he were not so typically American. It would be difficult to find personalities more national than Tolstoi or Dostoevsky, and this is perhaps the reason why they stand out as two of the most universal minds with a universal appeal that the nineteenth century has given us.</p><p>Zamiatin is not so great as the men referred to above, but despite his youth, he has already proved to have that quality of greatness that characterizes a personality with a universal appeal.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">We is, as Zamiatin himself calls it, the most jocular and the most earnest thing he has written thus far. It is a novel that puts before every thoughtful reader with great poignance and earnestness the most difficult problem that exists today in the civilized world—the problem of the preservation of the independent, original, creative personality. Our civilization depends</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent \">upon the energetic movement of great masses of people. Wars, revolutions, general strikes—all these phenomena involve great masses, large groups, enormous mobs. Despite the fact that there is hardly a corner in the world where the average man does not make the trite complaint, \"What we need is leadership,\" the world seems for a time, at least, to have lost its capacity to produce real leaders. For our great successes in mechanical civilization, our exceptional efforts in efficiency, tend to bring into play large masses rather than great individuals.</p><p>What, under these conditions, is the lot of the creative personality? The tragedy of the independent spirit under present conditions is pointed out in a unique way in We.</p><p>The problem of the creative individual versus the mob is not merely a Russian problem. It is as apparent in a Ford factory as under a Bolshevik dictatorship.</p>",
  "page-28": "<p>Of course, the sincere, honest, and frank treatment of this problem seems offensive to anyone who prefers to be a member of a mob or to keep this or that part of humanity in the state of a mob. That is why We could not be published in Russia, and will probably be disliked by those whose spiritual activities are reduced to the mechanical standards of a mechanical civilization which is devoid of original creative effort.</p><p>A few words should be said about the method by which Zamiatin tries to drive home his main ideas to the reader.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line\">It is the method of \"laughter through tears,\" to use an old expression of Gogol's. It is the form that is dictated by a profound love for humanity, mixed with pity for and hatred of those factors which are the cause of the disindividualization of man today. It is the old emotion of ancient Catullus : \"Odi et amo.\" Zamiatin laughs in order to hide his tears; hence amusing as We</p>",
  "page-29": "<p class=\"no-indent \">may seem and really is, it barely conceals a profound human tragedy which is universal today.</p><p>The reader may be interested in knowing something about Zamiatin himself. Zamiatin does not like to talk about himself, and the translator does not think he has the right to tell more than to quote Zamiatin's own answer to a request addressed to him a couple of years ago to write his autobiography:</p><p>\"I see you want my autobiography by all means, but I assure you that you will have to limit yourself only to an outside inspection and get but a glimpse, perhaps, into the dark windows.

As soon as We appeared in Volia Rossii, the Communist press in the U.S.S.R. opened a violent campaign against the author and indicted him for having given his novel, which was banned in Russia, to an emigre publication.

  "page-40": "<p class=\"no-indent \">and could not publish a line in Soviet periodicals. As he said later, by 1931 he became \"the Devil of Soviet literature, and since to spit on the Devil is considered a good deed, all the critics did nothing but spit on me as viciously as they could.\" His situation grew untenable, and he addressed a letter to Stalin asking for permission to go abroad, to \"rest awhile from baiting and persecution.\" Zamiatin's request was backed by Gorky who loved and admired the creator of</p><p>\"The District Tale,\" \"The Islanders,\" and many other stories which influenced a whole generation of Russian writers.

But the moment I expressed my scruples to Zamiatin, he dismissed them with a smile.

In the course of the four years Zamiatin stayed in Paris I saw him very often; in the fall of 1935 he shared my apartment, and we had long, intimate talks almost every evening.

Naval engineer and professional technician, he was</p>",
  "page-43": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line\">equally devoted to mathematics and to the arts, and united logic and imagination, precision and fantasy. In his conversation he used technological or theatrical terms indiscriminately, and would say: \"At this time I was living in the town of Nikolaiev; I constructed there several bulldozers and a few short stories.\" During the Revolution he trained a whole group of young men who later became known as \"Serapion Brothers\"—and he told me with his usual grin: \"I taught them the art of writing with ninety-proof ink.\" But this master of compact and lucid prose, this economic craftsman who preached \"functional expressionism,\" was, despite his cold and balanced exterior, a man of passions and delicate sensitivity. Alexander Blok, the great Russian poet, called him, with friendly mockery: \"The Englishman from Moscow.\" To all his friends the national traits of intensity and deep feelings, of profound inner life and idealistic aspirations, were</p>",
  "page-44": "<p class=\"no-indent \">apparent in Zamiatin. Like many people with a scientific background. he loved dreams and irrational flights and glorified man's desire to overcome all his limitations. The enemy of conventional rules, dogmatic strictures, and the letter of the law, he fought for the freedom of man in art and life. He told me with laughter how some petty tarty officials in Leningrad gasped with horror wnen he unfolded in a public meeting his beloved theory of \"the true revolution—the universal one, of which the social upheaval was but a minor aspect.\"</p><p>\"The most revolutionary process,\" stated Zamiatin, \"was cosmic and it encompassed the conservation of energy or its expense, the transformation of matter or the reduction of movement to immobility. And dogma,\" he would add, \"is the hard crust which imprisons the fiery magma, that molten material from which the hard rock is formed.\"</p>",
  "page-45": "<p>Zamiatin had had a rich and varied life—filled with creation, work, and struggle.

One evening while describing the details of his departure from Russia, he read me the letter he addressed to Stalin</p>",
  "page-46": "<p class=\"no-indent \">in 1931. Its opening passage sounded like an excellent self-characterization: \"I know,\" wrote Zamiatin, \"that I have the very uncomfortable habit of saying not what is advantageous at a given moment but whatever I believe to be the truth. I never concealed what I think of literary servility, toadyism, and coat changing.
