<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This is the superior wisdom, this is the summit of that pyramid around which people, red with sweat, fought and battled for centuries trying to crawl up!</p><p>Looking from this summit down to the bottom, where something is still left swarming like worms, from this summit all that is left over in us from the ancients seems alike. Alike are the unlawful coming motherhood of 0-9o, a murder, and the insanity of that Number who dared to throw verses into the face of the United State; and alike is the judgment for themâ€”premature death. This is that divine justice of which those stone-housed ancients dreamed, lit by the naive pink rays of the dawn of history.</p><p>Their "Cod" punished sacrilege as a capital crime.</p><p>You Uranians, morose and as black as the ancient Spaniards, who were wise in knowing so well how to burn at the stake, you are silent; I think you agree with me.</p></div> </div>
