This [Superbook](https://bubblin.io/docs/format) is brought to you by [Bubblin](https://bubblin.io/about)—The Book Publishing Company For The Web. [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/bubblin.png" width="18px" title="Bubblin Superbooks">](https://bubblin.io)



### TABLET FIRST & OFFLINE FIRST

Superbooks are responsive and generally [supported](https://bubblin.io/support) on all browsers and devices but the most ideal surface (recommended) to read the book on is a ~9" tablet like the iPad or Galaxy Tab. We try to suppport all devices and desktops—viz. all viewports, all modern browsers and all operating systems from an Apple Watch to an LCD TV. See our full list [here](https://bubblin.io/devices).

The live book is also _offline-first_ using a Service Worker, so no explicit download is required to read or share the book offline.

### MANUSCRIPT (this repo)

The manuscript on this repo has been generated programmatically using [Bookiza Abelone](https://bookiza.io), [h2s](https://github.com/bookiza/h2s) and other few other sanitization libraries. 


:point_right: The git repo here is the `manuscript` whereas the book is _live_ and served hot on production. This difference in the state of work is part of the vocabulary when publishing with Bookiza, note.


### FULLSCREEN MODE:

To be able to read the book in [fullscreen mode](https://bubblin.io/blog/fullscreen-api-ipad), please try these steps:

- Open the book on iOS (> 12.00) Safari
- Tap the `...` button at bottom right of the screen to open Superbook controls.
- Tap `⤮` on the top right (middle button) to go fullscreen.

iPadOS Safari v12.0 and above only.

## HACKING, FIXES AND TRANSLATIONS

	3. Install [Bookiza](https://bookiza.io) (requires node and npm),
