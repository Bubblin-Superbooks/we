<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent ">approximately what I felt, when I read the State Journal this morning. It has all been a terrible dream, and the dream is over. And I was so feeble, so unfaithful, that I thought of selfish, voluntary death! I am ashamed now to reread yesterday's last lines. But let them remain as a memory of that incredible what-might-have-happened, which will not happen! On the front page of the State Journal the following gleamed:</p><h6>Rejoice!</h6><p>For from now on we are perfect!</p><p>Until today your own creation, engines, were more perfect than you.</p><h6>Why?</h6><p>For every spark from a dynamo is a spark of pure reason; each motion of a piston, a pure syllogism. Is it not true that the same faultless reason is within you?</p></div> </div>
